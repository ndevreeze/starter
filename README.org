* What
 :PROPERTIES:
 :CUSTOM_ID: what
 :END:

Clojure and Genie starter kit - containing up-to-date versions of most used libraries in (Genie) scripts and Clojure applications.

* Why?
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: why
  :END:

When new versions of libraries appear, need to update a lot of project.clj and deps.edn files. Also the versions might be conflicting, especially in a Genie process where many scripts can run.

Some goals:

- Only include this starter library in genie scripts.
- Updates to libraries only in this starter-library
- Script automatically get the newest versions by using this starter.

* Installation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: installation
  :END:

Leiningen/Boot

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  [ndevreeze/starter "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Clojure CLI/deps.edn

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ndevreeze/starter {:mvn/version "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"}
#+END_EXAMPLE

[[https://clojars.org/ndevreeze/starter][https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/ndevreeze/starter.svg]]

The SNAPSHOT is by design, so new versions will be added automatically. At some point it might be needed to freeze a version.
* Usage
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: usage
  :END:

Require:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (ns my.namespace
     (:require [ndevreeze.starter :as starter]))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then require namespaces in the standard way.

* Developing

** Testing
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: testing
  :END:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ lein midje
#+END_EXAMPLE

or:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ lein repl (or start in Cider)
  (use 'midje.repl)
  (autotest)
#+END_EXAMPLE

** API Docs
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: api-docs
  :END:

See codox generated
[[https://ndevreeze.github.io/starter/api/index.html][API docs]] And cljdoc too: https://cljdoc.org/d/ndevreeze/starter/0.1.0-SNAPSHOT/api/ndevreeze

(change the version and visit the cljdoc link to generate new docs for new version)

Mostly not needed, just a few functions are available for checking if we have the right version.
** Creating docs
#+begin_src bash
lein codox
# commit and push to github
# wait a few minutes for github to push to ndvreeze.github.io
#+end_src

Also build Clojars docs from the site: https://cljdoc.org/d/ndevreeze/starter/0.1.0-SNAPSHOT/doc/readme

** Create a Github release

https://github.com/ndevreeze/starter/releases/new

Also create a tag for this release. Do a git pull to get tag locally after creating it online.
** Publish to Clojars
#+begin_src bash
lein deploy clojars
#+end_src
